JFBPDF is a framebuffer pdf/djvu file viewer forked from FBPDF. It currently
only actively supports the mupdf library for PDF files. See the Makefile for
other targets. The following options can be specified when starting jfbpdf:

  jfbpdf [-r rotation] [-z zoom x10] [-p page] path_to_file.pdf

See the man page for details.

CHANGES
=======

Differences between JFBPDF and upstream FBPDF:

  * Support for alternative framebuffer color depths: FBPDF originally only
    supports 32bpp mode framebuffer. JFBPDF additionally supports 16bpp and
    24bpp, which may be the only available color modes on older computers.

  * Page geometry detection: JFBPDF will detect the width and height of PDF
    pages, whereas FBPDF assumes a fixed maximum size and thus behaves
    strangely when scrolling.

  * Zooming features:
      - Support for progressive zooming with '+' ('=') and '-' keys
      - Support for auto zoom to screen width with the 's' key; this is also
        the default.
      - Zooming will preserve the view position (center of screen) within the
        current page.
      - Documents are centered horizontally / vertically on screen when page
        dimensions are less than screen dimensions.

  * Outline (TOC) view: JFBPDF has an outline view, toggled by the Tab key,
    that allows the user to browse through the outline / table of contents
    (TOC) embedded in the current document and jump to the corresponding
    locations.

  * Better controls: a range of keyboard shortcuts are added, including arrow
    keys, page up/down, etc..

  * Marks save all state (zoom, position, rotation, etc.).

Minor changes:

  * JFBPDF will move to the next / previous page when scrolling beyond the
    boundaries of the current page.

  * JFBPDF clears the screen when quitting instead of leaving garbage on
    screen.

  * Smoother horizontal panning.

  * The screen is cleard when zooming, so no garbage is left over from before
    the zoom.
