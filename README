JFBView
=====

JFBView is a PDF and image viewer for the Linux framebuffer. It is very fast and
has a number of advanced and unique features including:

  * Supports arbitrary zoom (10% - 1000%) and rotation.
  * Table of Contents (TOC) viewer for PDF documents.
  * Multi-threaded rendering on multi-core core machines.
  * Asynchronous background rendering of the next page.
  * Customizable multi-threaded caching.

BUILDING
--------

JFBView depends on MuPDF 1.x for PDF rendering and Imlib2 for image rendering.
Note that the 1.x MuPDF API is incompatible with the pre-1.0 MuPDF API, wich
means you cannot build JFBView against a pre-1.0 MuPDF library.

To build JFBView, just run 'make'.

It is also possible to build a variant of JFBView without support for images and
without dependency on Imlib2, which has a rather large list of dependencies
itself. This target is called JFBPDF. To build, run 'make jfbpdf'.

KEYS AND OPTIONS
----------------

The key bindings and command line options available are described in the man
page of JFBView. To view it, do `man jfbview'.

HISTORY
-------

JFBView started as a fork of FBPDF by Ali Gholami Rudi with improvements and bug
fixes, and was named JFBPDF. The JFBPDF code (in C) grew steadily more
convoluted as features were added, and finally was completely rewritten from
scratch in November 2012, with added support for images through Imlib2.
