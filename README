FBPDF
=====

fbpdf is a framebuffer pdf/djvu file viewer.  It can use either
mupdf or poppler libraries for rendering pdf files and it uses
djvulibre library for rendering djvu files.  Note that fbpdf
creates different binaries for each library.  So if you want to
use fbpdf only for viewing pdf files using mupdf library you
can compile it using "make fbpdf".  See the Makefile for other
targets.  The following options can be specified when starting
fbpdf (or fbdjvu and fbpdf2):

  fbpdf [-r rotation] [-z zoom x10] [-p page] filename
