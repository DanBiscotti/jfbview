=====

JFBView is a PDF and image viewer for the Linux framebuffer. It is very fast and
has a number of advanced and unique features including:

  * Arbitrary zoom (10% - 1000%) and rotation;
  * Table of Contents (TOC) viewer for PDF documents;
  * Interactive text search for PDF documents;
  * Multi-threaded rendering;
  * Asynchronous background pre-caching;
  * Customizable multi-threaded caching.

The home page of JFBView is at https://github.com/jichu4n/jfbview.

Please refer to the home page for more information, including installation
instructions and usage.

BUILDING
--------

JFBView depends on MuPDF 1.x for PDF rendering and Imlib2 for image rendering.
Note that the 1.x MuPDF API is incompatible with the pre-1.0 MuPDF API, wich
means you cannot build JFBView against a pre-1.0 MuPDF library.

JFBView makes use of C++14 features where available, so you will need a
compatible C++ compiler (GCC 4.9+, Clang 3.5+) to build it.

To build JFBView, just run `make`.

It is also possible to build a variant of JFBView without support for images and
without dependency on Imlib2, which has a rather large list of dependencies
itself. This target is called JFBPDF. To build, run `make jfbpdf`.

MUPDF VERSIONS
--------------

JFBView can be compiled against MuPDF 1.3 and up. To test compilation against a
particular version of MuPDF:

1. Obtain MuPDF headers and libraries at the particular version. For Arch Linux,
   historical package versions can be obtained at
   https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/l/libmupdf/.

2. Set `CXXFLAGS` to point to location of extracted package when invoking
   `make`, e.g.:
   ```
    make CXXFLAGS="-I../mupdf-1.12.0-2/usr/include -L../mupdf-1.12.0-2/usr/lib"
   ```

-------------

The key bindings and command line options available are described in the man
page of JFBView. To view it, do `man jfbview`, or check out the

HISTORY
-------

JFBView started as a fork of FBPDF by Ali Gholami Rudi with improvements and bug
fixes, and was named JFBPDF. The JFBPDF code (in C) grew steadily more
convoluted as features were added, and finally was completely rewritten from
scratch in November 2012, with added support for images through Imlib2.
