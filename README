JFBPDF
=====

JFBPDF is a framebuffer pdf/djvu file viewer forked from FBPDF. It currently
only actively supports the mupdf library for PDF files. See the Makefile for
other targets. The following options can be specified when starting fbpdf (or
fbdjvu and fbpdf2):

  fbpdf [-r rotation] [-z zoom x10] [-p page] filename

KEYS
====

The following table describes JFBPDF keybinding.  Most of these commands accept
a numerical prefix.  For instance, '^F' tells fbpdf to go to the next page
while '5^F' tells it to move to the fifth next page.

==============	================================================
KEY		ACTION
==============	================================================
^F/J		next page
^B/K		previous page
G		goto page (goto the last page if no prefix)
z		set zoom multiplied by 10 (i.e. '15z' = 150%)
=/+             zoom in
-               zoom out
s               zoom to screen width
r		set rotation in degrees
i		print info
q		quit
^[		(escape) clear numerical prefix
mx		mark page as 'x' (or any other letter)
'x		jump to the page marked as 'x'
`x		jump to the page and position marked as 'x'
j		scroll down
k		scroll up
h		scroll left
l		scroll right
H		show top
M		show middle
L		show bottom
' '/^D		(space) page down
^H/^U		(backspace) page up
^L		redraw
e		reload current file
TAB             open outline (TOC) view

Outline view keybindings:

CHANGES
=======

Differences between JFBPDF and upstream FBPDF:

  * Support for alternative framebuffer color depths: FBPDF originally only
    supports 32bpp mode framebuffer. JFBPDF additionally supports 16bpp and
    24bpp, which may be the only available color modes on older computers.

  * Page geometry detection: JFBPDF will detect the width and height of PDF
    pages, whereas FBPDF assumes a fixed maximum size and thus behaves
    strangely when scrolling.

  * Zooming features:
      - Support for progressive zooming with '+' ('=') and '-' keys
      - Support for auto zoom to screen width.

  * Outline (TOC) view: JFBPDF has an outline view, toggled by the Tab key,
    that allows the user to browse through the outline / table of contents
    (TOC) embedded in the current document and jump to the corresponding
    locations.

Minor changes:

  * JFBPDF will move to the next / previous page when scrolling beyond the
    boundaries of the current page.

  * JFBPDF clears the screen when quitting instead of leaving garbage on
    screen.

  * Smoother horizontal panning.
