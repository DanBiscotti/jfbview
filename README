HISTORY
=======

JFBView started as a fork of FBPDF by Ali Gholami Rudi with improvements and bug
fixes, and was named JFBPDF. The JFBPDF code (in C) grew steadily more
convoluted as features were added, and finally was completely rewritten from
scratch in November 2012, with added support for images through Imlib2.
