INSTALLATION
------------

Arch Linux:
  * Install package `jfbview` from the AUR, e.g.

    ```
      yay -S jfbview
    ```

  * Source: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jfbview

Debian / Ubuntu:
  * See [Releases page](https://github.com/jichu4n/jfbview/releases) for pre-built `.deb` packages for various Debian and Ubuntu versions.
  * To build from source, check out the build scripts in the `packaging` directory.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

jfbview uses MuPDF for PDF rendering and Imlib2 for image rendering.

Starting from version 0.5.8, jfbview uses a bundled version of MuPDF located in
the `vendor` directory in order to reduce the complexity from maintaining
compatibility with multiple MuPDF versions. This complexity comes from the fact
that MuPDF's API has historically changed quite frequently between versions,
and different Linux distributions ship with a wide range of MuPDF versions.

However, jfbview does use the system version of Imlib2 as it has not been a
source of compatibility issues so far.

jfbview makes use of C++14 features where available, so you will need a 
compatible C++ compiler (GCC 4.9+, Clang 3.5+) to build it.

Starting from version 0.5.8, jfbview uses CMake (version 3.2+) as its build
system.

It is also possible to build a variant of jfbview without support for images
and without dependency on Imlib2, which has a rather large list of dependencies
itself. To build this variant, specify the CMake flag
`-DENABLE_IMAGE_SUPPORT=OFF`. For backwards compatibility, this will also
enable an alias for `jfbview` called `jfbpdf`.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The key bindings and command line options available are described in the man
page of jfbview. To view it, do `man jfbview`.

HISTORY
-------

jfbview started as a fork of FBPDF by Ali Gholami Rudi with improvements and bug
fixes, and was named JFBPDF. The JFBPDF code (in C) grew steadily more
convoluted as features were added, and finally was completely rewritten from
scratch in November 2012, with added support for images through Imlib2.
